For our project, we decided to adapt a pretrained convolutional neural network to solve a specific problem in 
the realm of biochemistry: finding potent inhibitors of human voltage gated sodium ion channels. Sodium channels 
conduct nerve impulses in our bodies by allowing sodium ions to cross cell membranes. Because overactive sodium channels 
are responsible for a variety of dieseases, including chronic pain, scientists are in search of a ligand that will bind
selectively to isoforms of the human sodium channel. The Du Bois group at Stanford has conducted significant work 
designing sodium channel inhibitors that mimic the structure and function of potent neurotoxins. Thus, we aimed to design
a machine learning model to learn from their data and predict the experimental binding affinity of candidate inhibitors 
against rat and human sodium channels. In the process, we ran into some challenges featurizing and conducting machine 
learning on a very small biochemical dataset. Although our models predicted accurate ballpark experimental binding 
afifnity values, they are still not yet capable of distinguishing potent and non-potent sodium channel inhibitors.
